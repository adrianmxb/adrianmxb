### Hi folks, I'm Adrian! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I started developing software nearly a decade ago when I taught myself how to code at the age of 14.
Whilst still attending school, I decided to start my own business and have been developing software professionally ever since. Right now I am working as a Full Stack Engineer at [@ContractHero](https://github.com/ContractHero) changing how businesses are managing their contracts. Besides that I am building some cool prototypes over at [@highcard](https://github.com/highcard-dev). ðŸ¤“
